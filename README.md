A web app designed to allow users to post topics, videos and images similar to Reddit. Users can comment on posts and will be notified of any activity on their own posts.

Must add a config.json file with a secret similar to the example below:
  {
    "secret": "akdjfopiap oainv3208u9842hpoagnpovu n4qap9u8h4pa"
  }

Also, if the uploads folder doesn't exist, you must manually create it.
